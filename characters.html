    <h5>Captain America</h5>
    <h6>Identity: Steve Rogers</h6>
    <p class ="para">Steve Rogers is a World War II veteran, a founding member of the Avengers,
         and Earth's first known superhero. Rogers grew up suffering from numerous health problems, 
         and upon the United States' entry into World War II, he was rejected from serving in the
          United States Army despite several attempts to enlist. Rogers ultimately volunteered for
           Project Rebirth, where he was the only recipient of the Super Soldier Serum developed 
           by Abraham Erskine under the Strategic Scientific Reserve. The serum greatly enhanced Rogers' 
           physical abilities to superhuman levels. After Erskine's assassination and being doubted by 
           SSR head director Chester Phillips, Rogers was relegated to performing in war bond campaigns,
          where he posed as a patriotic mascot under the moniker of Captain America.</p>

    <h5>IRON MAN</h5>
    <h6>Identity: TONY STARK</h6>
    <p class ="para">Tony Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, 
        and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described
         as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical 
         knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and
          enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan,
           while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored 
           suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use
            against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. Following his fight against Stane,
             Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man.</p>

    <h5>THE HULK</h5>
    <h6>Identity: BRUCE BANNER</h6>
    <p class ="para">Bruce Banner is a renowned scientist and a founding member of the Avengers. 
        Highly respected for his work in biochemistry, nuclear physics and gamma radiation,
         Banner was tasked by Thaddeus Ross to recreate the Super Soldier Serum that
          created Captain America. However, Ross elected not to inform Banner what he was creating. 
          During the experiment, Banner substituted vita radiation for gamma radiation and administered
           the serum on himself. As a result, the mild-mannered scientist found that when angered,
            provoked or excited, his body and brain would transform into a huge, rage-fueled,
             primitive-minded creature known as the Hulk.</p>

    <h5>THOR</h5>
    <h6>Identity: THOR ODINSON</h6>
    <p class ="para">Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, the former king of both Asgard and 
        New Asgard, a founding member of the Avengers, and a former member of the Guardians
         of the Galaxy. When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior reignited an ancient
          war between Asgard and Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped 
          of his power and hammer Mj√∏lnir, he was banished to Earth by Odin. While exiled on Earth,
           Thor found love with Jane Foster, and learned humility by saving his new friends from
            the Destroyer sent by Loki. Due to his selfless act of sacrifice, Thor redeemed
             himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, which he then
              used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide.</p>

    <h5>BLACK WIDOW</h5>
    <h6>Identity: NATASHA Romanoff</h6>
    <p class ="para">Natasha Romanoff was one of the most talented spies and assassins 
        in the entire world and a founding member of the Avengers. As a child, she was indoctrinated 
        into the Red Room by General Dreykov, and briefly lived as the surrogate daughter of Alexei 
        Shostakov and Melina Vostokoff while they were undercover in the United States of America. 
        After the Destruction of the North Institute, she underwent extensive psychological conditioning, 
        before graduating from the Red Room as a Widow. Working as an operative for the KGB, she was 
        targeted by S.H.I.E.L.D., before given the chance to ultimately defect to the organization 
        by Clint Barton by assassinating Dreykov. Romanoff succeeded, although having to use his
         daughter Antonia Dreykov's life as collateral damage would haunt her for the rest of her life.</p>

    <h5>HAWKEYE</h5>
    <h6>Identity: CLINT BARTON</h6>
    <p class ="para">Clint Barton is an extremely skilled marksman, a former special
        agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and one of the founding members of the Avengers. Known for
         his use of the bow and arrow as his primary weapon and an extremely keen eyesight 
         and accuracy that earned him the codename Hawkeye, Barton had become one of the best 
         S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, responsible for the recruitment of Black Widow, with whom he 
         developed a strong friendship with. Assigned by Nick Fury into watching over the Tesseract,
          he was brainwashed by Loki and used as his pawn in his attempt to become king of Midgard. 
          However, following the Attack on the Helicarrier, he was freed from Loki's mental controls
           by Black Widow and joined the Avengers to fight against Loki and the Chitauri army in the
            Battle of New York, ending Loki's invasion, before Hawkeye returned to his work at a
             S.H.I.E.L.D..</p>
